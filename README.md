# Pomodoro

Thinkful Pomodoro Timer Project

A time-managment app based on the Pomodoro Technique developed with React

The user can:

- start/pause/stop the timer with associated buttons 
- increase/decrease focus and break time by incriments of 5 and 1 minute(s) respectively
- reset the timer to 25:00 by using the stop button

The default starting focus time is set to 25 minutes but can be adjusted.

The default starting break time is set to 5 but can be adjusted.

There is a progress bar for a visual representation of the time elapsed.

There's also an alarm that goes off at the end of the focus and breaks times each.
